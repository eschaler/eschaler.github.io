# Bio
Ethan Schaler is a Robotics Mechanical Engineer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in the Mobility and Robotic Systems Section / Extreme Environment Robotic Systems Group. With backgrounds in Electrical Engineering (PhD), Mechanical Engineering (BS), and Micro- / Nanotechnology (MPhil), Ethan collaborates with researchers in a variety of disciplines to design, model, fabricate, and characterize new robotic systems at µm- to cm-scales.

Ethan is an expert in integrating meso-scale devices – particularly flexible actuators, adhesives, and sensors – to form a functional robot. He is also proficient in manufacturing these devices at both macro- (3D printing, machining, etching) and micro- (deposition, micromachining) scales.

Ethan is always interested in exploring new, unique actuation and sensing technologies (electrostatic, magnetic, piezo, etc.), so feel free to reach out!

He has previously interned at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2016 and NASA Goddard in 2006, was the recipient of the Churchill, NSF GRFP, NDSEG, and Goldwater scholarships, and was awarded the Best Paper awared at IEEE Aerospace Conf. 2025 and the Best Student Paper award at MARSS Conf. 2018.
